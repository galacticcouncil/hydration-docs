With Hydrated Farms, providing liquidity to selected assets is incentivized by additional rewards on top of rewards from trading fees. To learn more, please visit the [dedicated product page](/products/trading/liquidity/omnipool_hydrated_farms).

## 00 Navigate to Liquidity Page
[https://app.hydration.net/liquidity](https://app.hydration.net/liquidity)

## 01 Provide Liquidity
Incentivized assets can be identified by the `Farm rewards` section which displays all available rewards for a given farm.

To join a farm, you must first provide liquidity ([step-by-step guide here](./provide_liquidity)).

# 02 Join Farm
Once you have provided liquidity for an incentivized asset, you can join its farm.

To do so, click on `Join farms` (located next to your liquidity position) and sign the transaction using your wallet app.

Happy hydrated farming!
