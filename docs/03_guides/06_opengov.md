## **The Referendum Process**

Before proceeding with making a referendum, identify the right track and origin for it. For instance, if the referendum is for requesting funds from treasury, select the treasury track with appropriate spend limits. Read [this post](/community/opengov) to learn more about Origins and Tracks.

Below is the ideal process to follow:

1. Create a discussion post about your proposal on Subsquare. This post allows the community to deliberate and recommend improvements.
2. Create a referenda on Subsquare.

That said, you are free to create a referenda without first creating a discussion post.

## **How to Create a Discussion Post**

1. Go to **Subsquare > Discussions > New Post**. You can do so following this link: [https://](https://hydradx.subsquare.io/post/create)[hydration.subsquare.io/post/create](https://hydration.subsquare.io/post/create)
2. Fill in the **title, label,** and **description** of your proposal.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img alt="subsquare_UI_new_discussion_post" src={useBaseUrl('/opengov_tutorials/new_discussion_post.jpg')} width="500px" />
</div>

3. Click **‘Create’** and sign the transaction.

Having created a discussion post for your proposal, you should share the link to the post on community channels and your socials. The goal is to get feedback from the community and also give you an opportunity to address any concerns raised.

## **How to Create a Referendum**

It is advisable to create a discussion around a proposal before making a referendum. This increases your chances of getting your referendum passed as you will get a chance a to listen to and act on community feedback and concerns.

1. Go to **Subsquare > Referenda > New Proposal** https://hydration.subsquare.io/referenda
    
    If you are familiar with creating preimages, then go ahead and choose any of the two main options (New preimage, I already have preimage).

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img alt="subsquare_UI_new_referendum" src={useBaseUrl('/opengov_tutorials/new_referendum.jpg')} width="500px" />
</div>
    
2. If you do not know how to use preimages, then select one of the **Quick Start** options that best fits your proposal. Below are the options:
    1. **Treasury spend local** - for proposals that want to request HDX.
    2. **Treasury USDx spend** - for proposals that seek to request USDC/T.
    3. **Remark** - for proposals that wish to propose changes to the protocol/ecosystem. most ideal for the ‘Wish for Change’ track.
3. In the following dialog box, enter all relevant details. It is important to specify the correct track for your proposal. Once done, click **‘Create Preimage’** and sign the transaction. This will create your proposal/referendum. But note that until you pay the Decision Deposit, this referendum is, in a sense, inactive since any votes won’t count. At this stage, there are two things you need to do.
4. **Add contextual information**. You can do this by editing the referendum to add the information. Or you can link to the discussion post you created before.
6. **Pay Decision Deposit**. Click the Decision Deposit button on the ’Status’ dialog box of your referendum page. Enter the required HDX and sign the transaction.

At this point, your referendum is now fully created and available for voting.

4. Enter the **HDX** value of your vote.
