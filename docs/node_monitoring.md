In this chapter we will walk you through the setup of local monitoring for your validator node.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You must have your [collator node](/collator_setup) up and running.  
This guide was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS release.

## Prometheus Setup {#prometheus-setup}

In the first step we will set up the Prometheus server.

### User and Directories {#user-and-directories}

We create a user just for monitoring purposes which has no home directory and can't be used to log in.

```shell script
$ sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin prometheus
```

Then we create directories for the executable and the configuration file.

```shell script
$ sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
$ sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
```

Change ownership of the directories to restrict them to our new monitoring user.

```shell script
$ sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
$ sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
```

### Install Prometheus {#install-prometheus}

Check latest version number of Prometheus at the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/).
At the time of writing it is v2.34.0. Insert the latest release version in the following commands.

```shell script
# download prometheus
$ wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.39.1/prometheus-2.39.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# unpack the binaries
$ tar xfz prometheus-*.tar.gz

# enter the unpacked directory
$ cd prometheus-2.34.0.linux-amd64
```

Now copy over the binaries into the local folder.

```shell script
$ sudo cp ./prometheus /usr/local/bin/
$ sudo cp ./promtool /usr/local/bin/
```

We now need to assign those binaries to our freshly created user.

```shell script
$ sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
$ sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/promtool
```

Next up we'll copy the web interface and the configuration presets.

```shell script
$ sudo cp -r ./consoles /etc/prometheus
$ sudo cp -r ./console_libraries /etc/prometheus
```

You may have guessed it already but we're also changing the ownership of those directories.

```shell script
$ sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles
$ sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries
```

We now have everything we need from the downloaded package so we will go one step back and do some cleanup.

```shell script
$ cd .. && rm -rf prometheus*
```

Let's create a `YAML` configuration file for Prometheus with the editor of your choice (nano / vim / pico).

```shell script
$ sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Our config is divided in three sections:

* `global`: sets the default values for `scrape_interval` and the rule-execution interval with `evaluation_interval`
* `rule_files`: specify rule-files the Prometheus server should load
* `scrape_configs`: this is where you set the monitoring-resources

We will keep it very basic and end up with something like this:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  # - "weHaveNo.rules"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
  - job_name: "substrate_node"
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9615"]
```

The first scrape job exports data of Prometheus itself, the second one exports the Hydration node metrics.
We adjusted the `scrape_interval` of both jobs to get more detailed statistics. This overrides the global values.
The `target` in `static_configs` sets where the exporters run, we stick to the default ports here.

After saving the configuration we will - once again - change the ownership.

```shell script
$ sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

### Starting Prometheus {#starting-prometheus}

To have Prometheus starting automatically and running in the background we'll use `systemd`.
Create a new config (again with the editor of your choice):

````shell script
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
````

Paste the following configuration and save the file.

```
[Unit]
  Description=Prometheus Monitoring
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network-online.target

[Service]
  User=prometheus
  Group=prometheus
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
  --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
  --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
  --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
  ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Next we will perform the following three steps:
`systemctl deamon-reload` loads new configurations and updates existing 
`systemctl enable` activates our new service
`systemctl start` triggers the execution of the service

You can perform the steps above in one command by executing:

```shell script
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable prometheus && systemctl start prometheus
```

You should now be able to access Prometheus' web interface at http://localhost:9090/.

## Node Exporter {#node-exporter}

We will install Node Exporter to scrape server metrics that will be used in the dashboard.  
Please check the version number of the latest release [here](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/) and update the command.  
At the time of writing the latest version was `1.3.1`.

### Install Node Exporter {#install-node-exporter}

Download the latest release.

```shell script
$ wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.4.0/node_exporter-1.4.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Unpack the archive you just downloaded. This will create a folder called `node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64`.

```shell script
$ tar xvf node_exporter-1.4.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Next we copy the binary into our local application directory and assign it to our monitoring user.

```shell script
# copy binary
$ sudo cp node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin

# set ownership
$ sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
```

We can now do some cleanup and remove the downloaded and unpacked package.

```shell script
$ rm -rf node_exporter*
```

### Create a Systemd Service {#create-a-systemd-service}

Similar to prometheus we want Node Exporter to run as a service too.  
Create a systemd service with your editor of choice.

```shell script
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
```

And paste the following configuration into it.

```
[Unit]
Description=Node Exporter
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

We will now activate and start the service with this one-liner.

```shell script
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable node_exporter && sudo systemctl start node_exporter
```

### Add Scrape Job for Node Exporter {#add-scrape-job-for-node-exporter}

The Node Exporter is now up and running but we need to tell Prometheus to scrape its data.
We will open the configuration file once again with the editor of choice.

```shell script
$ sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

And at the very bottom of the file we will append one more scrape config.
Paste the following content and save the file.

```yaml
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

Then apply the changes. A restart of the Prometheus service is required.

```shell script
$ sudo systemctl restart prometheus.service 
```

Your server metrics are now scraped and can be found in the Prometheus web interface.  
We will need them later for our dashboard.

## Grafana Setup {#grafana-setup}

We can see our metrics in the web interface, but that's not how we want to monitor it.   
We want it nice and beautiful. That's where Grafana comes into play. 

### Install Grafana {#install-grafana}

Please check what's the latest Grafana Version [with this link](https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=linux).  
You can either change the version number in the following commands or copy the install commands directly from the link.  
At the time of writing the latest version was `8.4.6`.

```shell script
$ sudo apt-get install -y adduser libfontconfig1
$ wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana_9.2.1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i grafana_9.2.1_amd64.deb
```

The package comes with a builtin `systemd`-service which we will configure and start just like the Prometheus service.

```shell script
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable grafana-server && sudo systemctl start grafana-server
```

### Accessing the Web Interface {#accessing-the-web-interface}

We'll be able to open the Grafana web interface at http://localhost:3000/.  
The default login Grafana is:  
User: `admin`  
Password: `admin`  

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/node-monitoring/grafana-home.png')} />
</div>

### Configuring the Datasource {#configuring-the-datasource}

Please click the settings gear in the menu and select datasources.  
In the next window you click "Add Datasource" and select "Prometheus".  

In the following form you don't need to change anything but the URL.  
Set `http://localhost:9090/` and click `Save and Test`.  

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/node-monitoring/grafana-datasource.png')} />
</div>

### Importing the Dashboard {#importing-the-dashboard}

Please click the `Plus`-button in the main navigation and select `import`.  

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/node-monitoring/grafana-import.png')} />
</div>  

We will use the [Hydration Dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14158) layout, so simply input the id `14158` and hit the `Load`-button.  

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/node-monitoring/grafana-import-options.png')} />
</div>  

You don't need much configuration here, just make sure Prometheus is used as the datasource.  
You can now finish the import.  

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/node-monitoring/grafana-dashboard.png')} />
</div>  

You should now see your dashboard right away.  
If some panels are empty please ensure your selection above the panels is like this:    
* `Chain Metrics`: Substrate  
* `Chain Instance`: localhost:9615  
* `Server Job`: node_exporter  
* `Server Host`: localhost:9100
