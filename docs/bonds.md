The Hydration Protocol uses **Bonds** as part of its strategy to **grow and diversify its Protocol-owned liquidity (POL)**. For this purpose, the Hydration Governance can at any time decide to **issue a given amount of bonds** which will be traded against assets that the Hydration Treasury wishes to accumulate.

All HDX bonds have a **maturity date**, which marks the moment when the bond can be **swapped against the underlying asset (HDX)**. The Hydration Protocol can decide the manner in which bonds are sold: For example, it can host a **dynamically priced LBP event**, or simply place an **OTC order against a fixed price**. Once acquired, bonds are **transferrable and tradeable on the secondary market** (e.g. OTC), also before they have reached maturity.

On this page you will find more info about bonds, including the process of a bonds campaign. For step-by-step guidance on how to participate in a bonds LBP, please visit [this guide](/howto_bonds_lbp).

## History of Bonds

The concept of bonds was first pioneered by OlympusDAO in 2021 as a tool which would help grow its POL. In the case of OlympusDAO, the Protocol was heavily relying on unsustainable yields as an incentivisation strategy for attracting liquidity - a strategy which ultimately resulted in an inefficient use of funds outside of bull markets.

## The Process of a Bonds Campaign

The first step of a Bonds campaign is the issuance of the bonds by the Protocol. Any member of the Hydration Community can initiate a governance discussion and a referendum to issue a given amount of bonds with a predefined maturity date, in order to obtain a given asset as POL.

Once bonds are issued, the Hydration Governance must decide on the method of trade. One option is to host a dedicated LBP event, which limited in time and allows for dynamic pricing thanks to the interplay between time-based weights shifting and demand (more info in our [LBP docs](/lbp)). Another option is for the Protocol to place an OTC order against a predefined price per bond.

## After a Bonds Campaign

All bonds have a maturity date. Once matured, the bonds can be swapped against the underlying asset (HDX) in a 1:1 ratio. In the meantime, the bonds are transferrable which means that they can be traded between users (e.g. by placing an OTC order).
