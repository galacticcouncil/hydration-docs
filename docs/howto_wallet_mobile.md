### Create Your Hydration Wallet

1. To create a new wallet, launch the Nova Wallet app and click the **Create A New Wallet** button.
2. Enter a name for your wallet to proceed.
3. Secure the Mnemonic Phrase displayed by the app, which is critical for account recovery. Please ensure you securely copy and store this phrase. Confirm its accuracy and continue.
    
    ***Caution**: Do not share your mnemonic phrase with anyone. It’s advisable to not take screenshots of this phrase. Write it down on a sheet of paper, and keep it in a safe place*
    
4. For added security, you will be asked to re-enter the mnemonic phrase in the correct sequence.
5. Set up your PIN which will be used for accessing the app.
