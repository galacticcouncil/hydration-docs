Hydration is a next-gen DeFi protocol built on Polkadot. Its mission is to make DeFi efficient, simple, and unstoppable. To achieve this, Hydration unites swaps, lending and a stablecoin currency under the roof of a single, scalable appchain.

At the heart of Hydration lies the innovative **[Omnipool](/products/trading/pools/omnipool)**, an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that fundamentally changes how liquidity works in DeFi. Rather than fragmenting liquidity across countless trading pairs, the Omnipool combines all assets into a single trading pool, enabling lower slippage, fewer hops between trades, and unprecedented capital efficiency gains. This breakthrough design also introduces **[1-sided liquidity provisioning](docs/02_products/01_trading/03_liquidity/01_single_sided_lp.md),** making it easier than ever for users to participate in market making.

Beyond the Omnipool, Hydration offers a comprehensive suite of DeFi tools including specialized stablepools, lending platforms, and **[advanced trading features](/products/trading/pro)** like yield and trade DCA. The protocol also caters to unique market needs through **Memepad**, a tool for creating meme coins without coding knowledge, and sophisticated **[DAO treasury management solutions](/daos)**, as demonstrated by the Polkadot DAO's $2 million stablecoin acquisition through Hydration.

Security and user experience form the bedrock of Hydration's design philosophy. The protocol combines multiple security audits, a generous bug bounty program, and sophisticated protection mechanisms with one of DeFi's most intuitive interfaces. By prioritizing organic revenue distribution without relying on new token mints, Hydration ensures long-term sustainability while making complex DeFi operations accessible to all users.

Stay hydrated, not liquidated.
