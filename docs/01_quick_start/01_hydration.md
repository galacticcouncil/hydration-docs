**Hydration** is a next-gen Layer-1 blockchain built on Polkadot, designed to **make DeFi efficient, simple, and unstoppable**. It unites the three fundamental pillars of DeFi - **trading, lending, and stablecoin** - under the roof of a single, scalable appchain.

### Trading: The Right AMM for Every Need
Hydration offers a comprehensive suite of Automated Market Makers (AMMs), each optimized for specific trading scenarios:

* The innovative **[Omnipool](docs/02_products/01_trading/01_pools/01_omnipool.md)** combines assets into a single trading pool, enabling lower slippage, fewer hops between trades, and unprecedented capital efficiency gains. It introduces **[1-sided liquidity provisioning](docs/02_products/01_trading/03_liquidity/01_single_sided_lp.md),** making market making more accessible than ever.
* **[Stablepools](docs/02_products/01_trading/01_pools/03_stablepools.md)** provide specialized environments for correlated assets like stablecoins or wrapped tokens (USDT/USDC/DAI or BTC/WBTC), offering minimal slippage and maximum capital efficiency.
* **[Isolated Pools](docs/02_products/01_trading/01_pools/02_isolated_pools.md)** allow for custom risk management and yield opportunities while protecting the broader protocol.
Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) empower new projects to achieve fair token distribution and initial price discovery, while also enabling the protocol to acquire Protocol-owned liquidity.

**[Advanced features](/products/trading/pro)** like yield optimization and DCA trading enhance the trading experience further.

The protocol also caters to unique market needs through **[Memepad](https://app.hydration.net/memepad)**, a tool for creating meme coins without coding knowledge, and sophisticated **[DAO treasury management solutions](/daos)**, as demonstrated by the Polkadot DAO's $2 million stablecoin acquisition through Hydration.

### Borrowing: Next-Generation Borrowing Infrastructure
Built on battle-tested foundations, Hydration's [borrowing](/products/borrowing) platform introduces groundbreaking improvements in efficiency and security. 
As a Polkadot appchain, Hydration ensures prioritized on-chain liquidations execute at the start of every block, eliminating the delays and MEV exploitation common on general-purpose chains. 

The protocol's innovative design internalizes liquidation rewards that typically go to bots, redirecting them to enhance protocol sustainability. Combined with enshrined oracle updates and sophisticated risk parameters, these features create one of DeFi's most secure and efficient lending environments.

### Stablecoin: HOLLAR
The upcoming HOLLAR stablecoin will complete Hydration's DeFi ecosystem, providing a native stable asset designed to work seamlessly with all protocol features.

## Security, User Experience, and Sustainability
Security and user experience are central to Hydration's design philosophy. The protocol combines multiple security audits, a generous [bug bounty](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/hydration/information/) program, and sophisticated protection mechanisms with one of DeFi's most intuitive interfaces. 
By prioritizing organic revenue distribution without relying on new token mints, Hydration ensures long-term sustainability while making complex DeFi operations accessible to all users.

Stay hydrated, not liquidated.
