Hydration is a next-gen DeFi protocol built on Polkadot. Its mission is to **make DeFi efficient, simple, and unstoppable**. To achieve this, Hydration **unites swaps, lending and a stablecoin currency** under the roof of a single, scalable appchain.

**The Omnipool lies at the heart of trading on Hydration**. It is an innovative Automated Market Maker (AMM) that combines all assets in a single trading pool, unlocking unparalleled efficiencies. By eliminating liquidity fragmentation, the Omnipool enables lower slippage and fewer hops, resulting in capital efficiency gains for traders.

The Omnipool supports single-sided liquidity provisioning, allowing anyone to provide liquidity for the asset they want, while the Omnipool handles the rest. Liquidity providers (LPs) gain instant exposure to all other assets in the pool. In the early phases, providing liquidity for selected assets is incentivized by Hydrated Farms, offering additional rewards on top of trading fees.

Hydration prioritizes security, with multiple audits, a generous bug bounty program, and cutting-edge mechanisms like liquidity caps, protocol fees, and circuit breakers to keep liquidity safe. The protocol also addresses impermanent loss (IL) through non-inflationary measures, ensuring LPs experience less IL when providing liquidity to the Omnipool.

Stay hydrated, not liquidated.
