# Deposit from Ethereum

Bridging assets from the Ethereum ecosystem is easy using the [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) bridge which is implemented by the [Moonbeam network](https://moonbeam.network/).

When bridging an asset, Wormhole will lock it on the source network and mint an equivalent amount of Wormhole-wrapped assets on the Moonbeam network. The assets are then transferred to the Hydration chain where they can be used for trading. In a few clicks and seamlessly.

To bridge assets from Ethereum to Hydration, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- A Polkadot wallet
- An Ethereum wallet
- ETH for transaction fees

### Step-by-step
1. Navigate to the [Carrier UI](https://www.carrier.so/)
2. As Destination, select `Hydration`
3. Connect your Ethereum wallet
4. Connect your Hydration wallet
5. Select the asset you wish to bridge and the amount
6. Click on `Settings` and turn on `Auto Relay`
7. Confirm and sign the transaction

Once finalized, the assets will appear in your Hydration wallet.
