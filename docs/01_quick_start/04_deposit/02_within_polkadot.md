On this page you will find a **step-by-step guide for performing cross-chain transfers**. 

Cross-chain transfers allow you to transport non-native assets to the Hydration chain from other Polkadot parachains, or from Polkadot itself.

Currently, the following tokens are supported by Hydration for cross-chain transfers:
* DOT
* DAI (from Acala, bridged via Wormhole)
* ETH  (from Acala, bridged via Wormhole)
* HDX

## 00 Prerequisites
Before you continue, please make sure you have sufficient amount of tokens on the destination chain for fees (ACA or DOT).
