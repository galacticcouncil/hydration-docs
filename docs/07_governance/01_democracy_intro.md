Hydration is in the process of fully decentralizing its governance. All decisions which affect the protocol are adopted following a democratic process which is supported by the Substrate democracy module. The central mechanism for establishing consensus among the stakeholders is the **referendum**.

This section contains a series of knowledge articles which should provide you with a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the governance of Hydration. You will find more information on [how referenda work](/democracy_referenda), as well as on the two central groups of governance actors: the [Hydration Council](/democracy_council) and the [Technical Committee](/democracy_technical_committee).

If you are looking for practical guidance on how to participate in the governance of Hydration, please refer to the step-by-step guides on [participating in referenda](/participate_in_referenda) and [participating in Council elections](/participate_in_council_elections).
