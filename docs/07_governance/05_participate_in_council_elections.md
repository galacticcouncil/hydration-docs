This article provides step-by-step guidance on how to participate in Council elections - voting for Council members and becoming a Council candidate.

If you are interested in how the election mechanism works, please refer to [this post](./democracy_council#elections).

## Using Polkadot/apps {#polkajs}
### Vote in Council member elections {#polkajs-vote}
You can see the current Council members as well as the runners-up on the [*Governance > Council* page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%253A%252F%252Frpc.hydradx.cloud#/council) in Polkadot/apps.

To bring out your vote for Council members, click on *Vote*.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/participate_in_council_elections/polkajs-vote.jpg')} />
</div>

Enter the amount of tokens you are willing to lock in support of your candidates.

After that, select your candidates in order of preference by moving them from the left list to the right one. Remember to select multiple candidates - this will help the algorithm select the optimal distribution of candidates to the Council.

To bring out your vote, click on *Vote* and sign the transaction.

:::note
Locked tokens cannot be transferred, however they can still be used for voting in referenda. Your tokens will remain locked and used for subsequent elections until you have decided to unlock them.
