title: Introduction
---

On Hydration, all decisions which affect the protocol are adopted through a governance process that puts token holders at the centre of decision making.

### Participants

These are the groups of decision makers and their roles in the governance process.

#### 1. Public

This group is inclusive of all HDX token holders. They can propose and vote on referenda.

#### 2. Technical Committee

This is a group of experienced engineers who are appointed by OpenGov referenda on the GeneralAdmin track (read [Origins and Tracks](/governance/origins_tracks) section to understand what this means). Their main task is to safeguard the technical stability of the protocol.

The Technical Committee has the power to whitelist referenda, which are then placed on the Whitelisted Caller track.  This is a quicker track with lower thresholds that can dispatch Root origin referenda that can alter the runtime. This enables the TC to swiftly fix any problems that may arise.

In addition to whitelisting referenda, the TC has another key function related to the security of the [Omnipool](/products/trading/pools/omnipool): targeted function pausing. This allows the TC to temporarily pause certain or all actions relating to specific assets. Thus, in the case of an emergency or detection of suspicious behaviour, the TC has the power to make any asset non-tradable.
