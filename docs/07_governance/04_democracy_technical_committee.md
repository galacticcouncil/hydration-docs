title: Technical Committee

The Technical Committee is a group of experienced core developers which is appointed directly by the Hydration Council. Its main task is to safeguard the technical stability of the protocol.

The Technical Committee has the right to **produce emergency referenda** which are fast-tracked and voted in parallel with any other active referenda. This allows the Committee to act quickly and deliver critical (code) changes.

Another important power of the Technical Committee is the ability to **cancel referendum proposals** which are deemed to be detrimental to the protocol. In order to cancel a referendum proposal, the Committee must agree unanimously.
