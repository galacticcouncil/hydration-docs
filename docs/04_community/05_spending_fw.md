# Contributing to Hydration

Hydration welcomes community contributions that benefit the protocol and its ecosystem. There are several ways to contribute and potentially receive rewards for your efforts.

## Bug Bounties

Hydration's primary bug bounty program operates through Immunefi, a leading platform for blockchain security bug bounties. This program incentivizes security researchers and developers to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in Hydration's codebase and infrastructure.

The program covers multiple areas including blockchain vulnerabilities, smart contract issues, and website/application security flaws. Bounty amounts vary based on the severity and potential impact of discovered vulnerabilities, with the highest rewards reserved for critical findings that could significantly impact the protocol.

To participate in the bug bounty program, security researchers should follow the responsible disclosure guidelines and submission procedures outlined on the platform. All submissions must adhere to the program's terms and conditions to be eligible for rewards.

## Tips

Community members can request tips for work they've completed that benefits the Hydration ecosystem. Tips can be requested by contributors themselves or nominated by other community members on behalf of deserving contributors.

Tip requests are submitted through Hydration's OpenGov system, where HDX holders vote on whether to approve the requested tip. The community evaluates contributions based on their value to the protocol, quality of execution, and overall benefit to the ecosystem.

Examples of tip-worthy contributions include developing useful tools, providing technical support to the community, or other activities that meaningfully advance the Hydration ecosystem.

## OpenGov Funding

Contributors can request funding from the Hydration Treasury through the OpenGov governance process for various projects and initiatives. This route allows for both pre-funding of planned work and retroactive compensation for completed contributions.

**Important Considerations:**

OpenGov funding is challenging to secure and should not be relied upon as a guaranteed income source. Unless the value provided is exceptionally high and undeniably beneficial to the protocol, proposals face significant hurdles in the voting process.

**Pre-funding:** Requesting funds before completing work is particularly difficult unless the proposer has established reputation within the community and/or the proposed work is highly desirable to HDX holders.

**Retroactive funding:** Some contributors pursue this approach by completing work first and then requesting compensation. While this can work, it also carries the risk that the community may not approve funding even after work is completed.

**Proposal Success Factors:**

- Clear demonstration of value to the protocol
- Established reputation within the community
- High-quality deliverables or proven track record
- Strong alignment with community priorities
- Reasonable funding requests relative to expected impact

## Getting Started

Before beginning any contribution work, especially if you're hoping for compensation, it's recommended to engage with the community first. You can:

- Discuss your ideas in the Hydration Discord or community forums
- Gauge community interest and get feedback on your proposed contribution
- Connect with other contributors and learn from their experiences
- Understand current community priorities and needs

:::warning Funding Not Guaranteed
Remember that all funding decisions ultimately rest with HDX holders through the governance process. While quality contributions are valued, there are no guarantees that any particular contribution will receive compensation.
