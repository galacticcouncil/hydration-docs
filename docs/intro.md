HydraDX is a next-gen DeFi protocol which is designed to **bring an ocean of liquidity to Polkadot**. Our tool for the job the **HydraDX Omnipool** - an innovative Automated Market Maker (AMM) which **unlocks unparalleled efficiencies** by **combining all assets in a single trading pool**.

By putting an **end to liquidity fragmentation**, the HydraDX Omnipool makes trading efficient like no other AMM. Thanks to **lower slippage and less hops**, traders can enjoy capital efficiency gains (which scale further with TVL) as compared to a typical situation where liquidity is fragmented across different trading pools ([learn more](/omnipool_trading)).

The design of the HydraDX Omnipool empowers **single-sided liquidity provisioning** - anyone can provide liquidity only for the asset they want, and the Omnipool will take care of the rest ([learn more](/omnipool_lp)). In the early phases of bootstrapping growth, providing liquidity for selected assets will be incentivized by **Hydrated Farms** - additional rewards on top rewards from trading fees which grow over time ([learn more](/omnipool_hydrated_farms)).

Single-sided LPing is an especially powerful concept for **treasuries of DAOs and other projects** who can supply their asset to the Omnipool - **trustlessly via XCM**, and gain **instant exposure to an ocean of assets**. Without hidden fees for market makers, **while building up (diversified) POL from trading fees** ([learn more](/omnipool_treasuries)).

The HydraDX Omnipool enjoys **state of the art security**: The underlying code has underwent **multiple audits**, and there is a **generous bug bounty program** incentivizing the **responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities**. Besides that, a combination of cutting-edge mechanisms such as liquidity caps, protocol fees and circuit breakers work together to keep your liquidity safe ([learn more](/omnipool_security)).

Building upon **2+ years of R&D**, HydraDX has found ways to address another pain point of AMMs - **impermanent loss (IL)**. Thanks to a **combination of non-inflationary measures**, liquidity providers will **experience less IL** when providing their liquidity to the Omnipool ([learn more](/omnipool_impermanent_loss)).

Stay hydrated, not liquidated.
