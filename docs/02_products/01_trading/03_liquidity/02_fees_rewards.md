title: Fees, Rewards, and Penalties

Hydration revolutionizes liquidity provision with a uniquely simple approach: you only need to supply a single token to start earning (learn more about [single-sided lping](docs/02_products/01_trading/03_liquidity/01_single_sided_lp.md)). This innovative design eliminates the complexity typically associated with liquidity mining while maximizing capital efficiency.

## Fees & Rewards
When you provide liquidity on Hydration, your earnings come from two sources:
1. **Trading Fees:** Earn your share of fees generated from all trading activity in the pools.
2. **Farm Rewards:** Participate in seasonal farming campaigns for additional token rewards.

Currently, you can provide liquidity for a growing list of tokens including DOT, ETH, BTC, USDC, USDT, GLMR, ASTR, and many Polkadot ecosystem tokens. The current liquidity mining campaign, running until December 2025, offers substantial rewards with up to 85% APR for major assets and 38% APR for stablecoins.

## On Claiming
Hydration uses an innovative reward system that incentivizes long-term liquidity provision. 

**How it works**:
When you participate in farming, your rewards accumulate over time. The longer you maintain your position, the faster your rewards accumulate - rewarding long-term liquidity providers with enhanced earning rates.
The system includes a customizable claiming threshold that puts you in control of your reward strategy.

### Claiming Threshold and Penalties
Your claiming threshold (default 99%) determines when you can collect your accumulated rewards. With a 99% threshold, you can claim when 99% of your total rewards have unlocked.
You can lower this threshold (e.g., to 80%) to claim more frequently, but this means forfeiting any locked rewards at the time of claiming. After claiming, your acceleration starts fresh and begins building again

**For example**, if you have 1000 tokens in accumulated rewards and an 80% claiming threshold:
* You can claim 800 tokens when they unlock.
* The remaining 200 locked tokens would be forfeited upon claiming.
* After claiming, you start fresh and begin building your earning rate again.

This design gives you the flexibility to balance between frequent access to rewards and maximizing your total earnings. Patient liquidity providers who wait for full unlocking will earn the highest rewards.
