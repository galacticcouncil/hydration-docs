Hydration revolutionizes liquidity provision with a uniquely simple approach: you only need to supply a single token to start earning (learn more about [single-sided lping](/products/trading/liquidity/single_sided_lp)). This innovative design eliminates the complexity typically associated with liquidity mining while maximizing capital efficiency.

## Fees & Rewards
When you provide liquidity on Hydration, your earnings come from two sources:
1. **Trading Fees:** Earn your share of fees generated from all trading activity in the pools.
2. **Farm Rewards:** Participate in seasonal farming campaigns for additional token rewards.

Currently, you can provide liquidity for a growing list of tokens including DOT, ETH, BTC, USDC, USDT, GLMR, ASTR, and many Polkadot ecosystem tokens. The current liquidity mining campaign, running until December 2025, offers substantial rewards with up to 85% APR for major assets and 38% APR for stablecoins.

## Claiming Threshold
Hydration features a flexible reward system that puts you in control of your earnings strategy.

When you participate in farming, your rewards accumulate over time. You can customize how and when you receive these rewards through the claiming threshold feature.

The **claiming threshold** is a customizable percentage that determines when you can collect your accumulated rewards. By default, it's set to 99%, meaning you can claim when 99% of your total rewards have unlocked.
You have the flexibility to adjust this threshold based on your preferences:

* Set a higher threshold (like 99%) to maximize your total rewards
* Set a lower threshold to access your rewards more frequently

**For example**, with 1000 tokens in accumulated rewards:

* At 99% threshold: You can claim 990 tokens when they unlock
* At 80% threshold: You can claim 800 tokens when they unlock

After claiming, your rewards begin accumulating again from that point forward.

This system gives you complete control over your reward strategy, allowing you to balance between frequent access to rewards and maximizing your total earnings. The choice is yours!
